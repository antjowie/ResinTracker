## What is Resin Tracker
[Genshin Impact][gensinimpact] (GI) is a beautiful game that unfortunately has taken all my time as of lately. Since it is a Gacha game, time-gating practices are put into practice. In GI this is known as Resin (your energy equivalent for most mobile games). To no longer be worried about maxing my Resin and optimizing my already no life schedule, I have decided to create this project to track it.

## What will it do
Resin Tracker allows you to check your current Resin from anywhere. Just go to the [website](webiste)(to be created) or use the [Discord bot](discord)(to be created). 

Resin Tracker allows you to set up notifications for when certain Resin values are met. Finally, you can link your Discord account so that you can see your Resin from all machines.

## Development
Feel free to contribute to this project. You can use anything in this project, just make sure to credit me.

## Roadmap
Development started in week 47 of 2020. That's where I will start counting. I estimate a scope of a month.
| Week | Milestone |
| --- | --- |
| 47  | Research and create a design (database, multiple interfaces, CICD/deployment options) |
| 48  | Setup back end and main logic, deploy remotely |
| 49  | Setup Discord bot |
| 50  | Setup web interface |
