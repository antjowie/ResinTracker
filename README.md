## What is ResinTracker?
Resin is the 'energy currency' of [Genshin Impact][gensinimpact] (GI). The ResinTracker project is a collection of tools to track this currency outside of the game. It is the stack with web API and a [Discord frontend](discord) (a bot) that will notify you when your Resin is about to cap.

## What is Genshin Impact and Resin?
[Genshin Impact][gensinimpact] (GI) is a beautiful game that unfortunately has taken all my time as of lately.  
Since it is a Gacha game, time-gating practices are put into practice. In GI this is known as Resin (your energy equivalent for most mobile games). To no longer be worried about maxing my Resin and optimizing my already no life schedule, I have decided to create this project to track it.
